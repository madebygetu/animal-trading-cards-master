			<p>Ethiopian wolves are the rarest of all canids.
				In fact, they are one of the rarest mammals worldwide,and are endangered.
				Ethiopian wolves are believed to have evolved from grey wolves that migrated
				from Eurasia to Northern Africa around 100,000 years ago. They are closely related
				to domestic dogs, coyotes and grey wolves. Their habitat lies in a remote part of
				Ethiopia known as the Afroalpine highlands.</p>
